# Human Machine Interface!

Human Machine interface is the way through which humans and computers communicate with one another. 
The human-machine interface consists of the hardware and software that are used to transform user input into instructions and to show results to the user.



 >Combining machine learning with creative applications of sensors, we are planning to interact with the computer through our iris movement. 
  A face recognition model will be used to only recognize the interactive user, so we can bypass any other user located around.  
  The system will recognize the user face to take from him instructions through his iris movement and to avoid distractions from any other human. 
  A sound localization system will be there when the user makes a specific sound, the AI algorithm can track the location and size to visualize 
  the data just like a map so the camera system can follow the map to recognize and track the iris movements from the user.
  This means that the user doesnâ€™t have to be located directly in front of the computer so the limitations of the technology 
  are lowered!
